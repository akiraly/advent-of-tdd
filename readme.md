## Morgan Stanley Advent of TDD (Advent of Code 2023 solutions in TDD style)

* Kotlin 1.9.21
* [Kotest](https://kotest.io/) for testing
* JVM 21
* Gradle 8.5
* Intellij 2023.2.5 with latest stable Kotlin and Kotest plugins

Kotest has a rich set of features including multiple
different [testing styles](https://kotest.io/docs/framework/testing-styles.html).
Different days sometimes use different styles because I am experimenting with them.
